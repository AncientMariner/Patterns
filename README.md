<h3>Design Patterns code examples</h3>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Strategy">Strategy</a> Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Observer">Observer</a> Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Decorator">Decorator</a> Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Factory">Factory</a> Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Singleton">Singleton</a> Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Command">Command</a> Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Adapter">Adapter</a> Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Template">Template</a> Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Iterator">Iterator</a> Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Composite">Composite</a> Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/State">State</a> Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Proxy">Proxy</a> Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

The <a href="https://github.com/AncientMariner/Patterns/tree/master/Patterns/src/main/java/org/xander/Compound">Compound</a> pattern combines patterns with each other
